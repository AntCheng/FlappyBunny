## The funny game you shouldn't miss for killing time

A *bulleted* list:
- **simple and cute game**
- **relax and killing time**
- **for all ages**

*This desktop application is a simple game. It would be helpful for killing time. It doesn't involve complicated 
    operation, so anyone could play it. The interest for why I design this game is because, when I was a child, 
    I don't just want to play game, I also want to design game. Even though this project would be a simple small
    game, I would like to design it just for dream.*
